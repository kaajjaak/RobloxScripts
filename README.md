# Roblox Scripts
This is a repository of all my (public) Roblox Scripts!
I am planning to add a lot more, all FOSS ofc!

## Requests

Feel free to request me any game you want and I'll see what I can do for you!

## How to use?

All of these scripts are written and tested with [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to/).

I have no clue whether or not they will work with KRNL or any other exploits!

## Do they still work?

I can only guarantee they were all working at the time of the last commit of each individual script! 

Feel free to make an issue if you believe any of them aren't working as intended and I see what I can do.


## Credit

You are allowed to use these scripts for free, however if you do decide to post them on your own website or YouTube video, you have to credit both me and this GitHub repository.

If you like any of my scripts and would like to thank me, please star this GitHub repository!

## Legal Disclaimer

If you own made of the games I have made a script for and want it to be taken down, feel free to make an issue on this repository so that we can discuss possibly taking it down.

I am just a student making these for fun so please do not file any DMCA takedowns, additionally these are all fair use so any unlawful actions made towards this repository will be countered with legal action.
